# Constraining the physical and chemical structure of young embedded disks is crucial for understanding the earliest stages of planet formation. As part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Large Program, we present high spatial resolution (~0.″1 or ~15 au) observations of the 1.3 mm continuum and 13CO J = 2-1, C18O J = 2-1, and SO J N = 65-54 molecular lines toward the disk around the Class I protostar L1489 IRS. The continuum emission shows a ring-like structure at 56 au from the central protostar and tenuous, optically thin emission extending beyond ~300 au. The 13CO emission traces the warm disk surface, while the C18O emission originates from near the disk midplane. The coincidence of the radial emission peak of C18O with the dust ring may indicate a gap-ring structure in the gaseous disk as well. The SO emission shows a highly complex distribution, including a compact, prominent component at ≲30 au, which is likely to originate from thermally sublimated SO molecules. The compact SO emission also shows a velocity gradient along a direction tilted slightly (~15°) with respect to the major axis of the dust disk, which we interpret as an inner warped disk in addition to the warp around ~200 au suggested by previous work. These warped structures may be formed by a planet or companion with an inclined orbit, or by a gradual change in the angular momentum axis during gas infall.
